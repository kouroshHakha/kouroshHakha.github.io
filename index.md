I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Berkeley. I am co-advised by 
<a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/vlada.html" target="_blank">Vladimir Stojanovic</a> and 
<a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a>. My main research interests
are Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning,
Optimization, and Design Automation. My current research lies at the intersection of AI and 
Integrated Circuit Design. In this area we try to incorporate/build Machine Learning tools to automate analog circuit
design to realize “no human in the loop” design flows. This demands sample efficient machine
learning algorithms due to the difficulty of obtaining data.

I received my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology, Iran in Electrical Engineering, in 2017, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2019.

In my journey in PhD I realized I am very interested in deep learning. Plus the fact that I had a solid background in
optimization, linear algebra and probability and statistics, so I decided to work on something 
that leverages my undergrad knowledge and build an automation system that
circuit designers really care about.  

I am very much into entrepreneurship and startups. Currently, I am interning at a venture, spun out 
of UC Berkeley, called 
<a href="https://www.bcanalog.com/" target="_blank">BlueCheetah Analog Design Inc</a>, where we develop analog IPs using our open 
source, agile, hardware design platform.
