title: About
---

I am a 3rd year PhD student at UC Berkeley. I am co-advised by Vladimir Stojanovic and Pieter
Abbeel. My main research interest is Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning and
Optimization. My current research lies at the intersection of AI and Integrated Circuit Design
. In this area we try to incorporate/build Machine Learning tools to automate analog circuit
design to realize “no human in the loop” design flows. This demands sample efficient machine
learning algorithms due to the difficulty of obtaining data.

I received my Bachelors from Sharif University of Technology, Iran in Electrical Engineering. I
was awarded the best thesis award for my work on building an energy efficient remote ECG monitoring
system. 

In my journey in PhD I realized I am very interested in deep learning plus my background in
optimization, linear algebra and probability and statistics was pretty solid, so I decided to
work on something that leverages my undergrad knowledge and build an automation system that
designers really care about.  

I am very much into entrepreneurship and startups. Currently, I am interning at a venture, spun out 
of UC Berkeley, called BlueCheetah Analog Design Inc, where we develop analog IPs using our open 
source, agile, hardware design platform.
