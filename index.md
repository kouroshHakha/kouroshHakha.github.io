I am a PhD student at Berkeley AI Research working on machine learning, especially in Reinforcement Learning, Unsupervised learning, and their applications in robotics and automated design. I am generally interested in problems where deep learning algorithms can get applied and make breakthroughs. I am co-advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/" target="_blank">Pieter Abbeel</a> and 
<a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/vlada.html" target="_blank">Vladimir Stojanovic</a>. 
<!-- 
My current research lies at the intersection of AI and 
Integrated Circuit Design. In this area we try to incorporate/build Machine Learning tools to automate analog circuit
design to realize “no human in the loop” design flows. This demands sample efficient machine
learning algorithms due to the difficulty of obtaining data.
 -->
I received my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology, Iran in Electrical Engineering, in 2017, and my M.Sc. in Computer Science from UC Berkeley in 2019.
<!-- 
In my journey in PhD I realized I am very interested in deep learning. Plus the fact that I had a solid background in
optimization, linear algebra and probability and statistics, so I decided to work on something 
that leverages my undergrad knowledge and build an automation system that
circuit designers really care about.  
 -->

In the past I have interned at both startup companies (<a href="https://www.bcanalog.com/" target="_blank">BlueCheetah Analog Design Inc</a>) and industry (AI intel Labs).
<!--  am very much into entrepreneurship and startups. Currently, I am interning at a venture, spun out 
of UC Berkeley, called 
, where we develop analog IPs using our open 
source, agile, hardware design platform.  -->
